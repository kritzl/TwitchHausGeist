# TwitchHausGeist
This Twitch Bot offers two different usages. 

### Vote Bot

Checks every chat message for the following beginnings:

results in | trigger
--- | ---
neutral | `+-` `-+` `+/-` `-/+` `haugeNeut`  
plus | `+` `haugePlus`  
minus | `-` `haugeMinu`  

Posts an interim result every 20 seconds and an end result after 5 seconds of no additional votes.

Checks if more than 10 votes have been added before posting any result.


### Pipi Bot

Offers four commands to count the number of chat users who need to go to the toilet.

    !pipi -> To mention, that you need to go to the toilet
    !warpipi -> To mention, that you have been to the toilet before a break was announced
    !zuspÃ¤t -> Mention, that is now too late, and you had an accident
    !pipimeter -> Get the current count of users that need to go to toilet
    !pause -> Announce a break and reset the counter
    !reset -> Resets all pipi-votes
